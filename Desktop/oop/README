Since i haven't submitted on the 17th and 18th because i was sick this commit includes 3 methods of strings including one for today.

The first method is isupper() this is a python string method that can be called and returns a boolean. True if the variable called on contains all uppercase English letters and False if it doesn't.

The next method is upper() this is another string method. This will change all the letters to uppercase.

And lastlty for today I have tried to see string concatenation using + sign this method concatenates two strings and forms or returns another string.

I have provide all the examples in strings.py file.

Thanks,
Milkiyas
