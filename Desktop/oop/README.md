## Strings Methods

The first method is isupper() this is a python string method that can be called and returns a boolean. True if the variable called on contains all uppercase English letters and False if it doesn't.

The next method is upper() this is another string method. This will change all the letters to uppercase.

The third method is called count(). when ever count is called on a string it expects a value/string/letter to be passed in it and it will return how many of that value appears in the string we called it on

I have tried to see string concatenation using + sign this method concatenates two strings and forms or returns another string.

I have provide all the examples in strings.py file.

Today's string method is what is called slicing. slicing helps us cut a part of the string and returns it based on the indicies we passed to it. for example:
string[0:2] slices the "string" variable which holds a string starting from the value at the 0 index upto the second index but not including the value at the second index.

As usual i have provided an example in the strings.py file.

Today's method is strip()

it Removes leading and trailing whitespace from a string. as shown in example strings.py. one very useful function of this strings method is when taking inputs from the user and we dont want any traling spaces, we use .strip().

Today's string method is split()

split in pyton changes a given string in to a list. by passing whatever we want in the parenthesis we can split it based on space or any value. for example: string.split() splirts the string based on spaces.this will internally remove any traling white spaces. additional examples can be found in strings.py

swapcase()
The swapcase() is a string method that returns a string by swaping the case of the letter uppercase to lowercase and lowercase to uppercase. it can be called like this string.swapcase(). example in strings.py

isdigit()
The isdigit() method returns a boolean (true or false) checking if the string is a digit forexample: string="1" string.isdigit() will return: True. but string="a", string.isdigit() will return False.

str.startswith()
The str.startswith() function checks whether a given string begins with a specific substring. It returns True if the match is found at the beginning and False otherwise.

str.endswith()
Similar to str.startswith(), the str.endswith() function determines whether a string concludes with a particular sequence of characters, returning a boolean result.

str.title()
The str.title() function converts the first letter of each word in a string to uppercase while making all other letters lowercase. It works well in most cases but might not handle words with apostrophes correctly.

str.replace()
The str.replace() method substitutes occurrences of a specific substring with another substring. This method does not modify the original string but returns a new modified version.

f-strings (f"")
f-strings (formatted string literals) allow you to embed expressions inside string literals using {}. This provides a more readable and concise way to format strings.

len()
The len() function returns the number of characters in a string (or elements in a list, tuple, etc.).

str.join()
The str.join() function joins a list of strings using the given string as a separator.

### Isalnum

- **Example:** `'hello123'.isalnum()`
- **Description:** Checks if a string is composed entirely of letters and numbers without any spaces or special characters. This is useful for enforcing constraints on usernames or passwords that require alphanumeric input only.

### Find

- **Example:** `'hello world'.find('world')`
- **Description:** This method searches for a substring within a given string and returns the lowest index where the substring is found. If the substring is not present, it returns -1. It's useful when you need to check if a certain word or character sequence exists within a larger string.

### Isspace

- **Example:** `' '.isspace()`
- **Description:** Returns True if the string contains only whitespace characters (spaces, tabs, newlines). This method is useful for checking if user input is empty or improperly formatted.

### Replace

- **Example:** `'hello world'.replace('world', 'Python')`
- **Description:** Replaces all occurrences of a specified substring with another string. This is useful for text transformations, such as replacing certain words or characters dynamically in a sentence.

### Rstrip

- **Example:** `'hello '.rstrip()`
- **Description:** Similar to lstrip(), but it removes trailing whitespace or specified characters from the right side of the string. This is useful when handling text input where unnecessary spaces at the end may cause issues.

## Lists Methods

### Pop

- **Example:** `my_list.pop()`
- **Description:** Removes and returns the last element from the list. If an index is provided, it removes the element at that position.

### Sort

- **Example:** `my_list.sort()`
- **Description:** Sorts the list in ascending order. This modifies the list in place, so be careful if you need to keep the original order.

### Append

- **Example:** `my_list.append(4)`
- **Description:** Adds an element to the end of the list. Useful for dynamically growing lists without worrying about indices.

### Extend

extend()
The extend() method adds all elements of an iterable (list, tuple, etc.) to the end of the list.

## Insert

insert()

The insert() method inserts an element at a specified position in the list.

### Index

index()

The index() method returns the index of the first occurrence of a specified value.

copy()
The copy() method creates a shallow copy of a list, meaning it duplicates the original list without modifying it.

clear()
The clear() method removes all elements from a list, making it empty.

count()
Counts how many times a specific value appears in the list.

### Reverse

reverse()
Reverses the order of elements in the list.

## Remove

remove()
Removes the first occurrence of a value in the list.

## max

max()
Returns the largest element in a list.

## Reversed

Returns a reversed iterator (does not modify the list).

## List

Converts other data types (tuple, string, set, etc.) into a list.

## Del

Removes an item at a specific index using del.

## zip

Combines multiple lists element-wise.

## all

all()
Returns a bollean(True) only if all elements in the list are True

## any

This is opposite to all() which returns True if at least one element in the list is True.

## DICTIONARY

## get

Returns the value for a key if it exists, otherwise returns a default value.

## keys

Returns a view of all the keys in the dictionary.

## pop

Removes a key and returns its value

## clear()

Removes all items from the dictionary.

## setdefault()

Returns the value of a key; if key is not present, inserts it with a default value.

## popitem()

Removes and returns the last inserted key-value pair.

## update()

Updates the dictionary with key-value pairs from another dictionary or iterable.

## items()

Returns a view of all key-value pairs as tuples.

## values()

Returns a view of all the values in the dictionary.

## fromkeys()

Creates a new dictionary from a sequence of keys, all with the same value.

## copy()

Returns a shallow copy of the dictionary.

## in (operation not method)

in â†’ check if a key exists:

## count()

Counts occurrences of an item.

## index()

Returns the index of first occurrence.
